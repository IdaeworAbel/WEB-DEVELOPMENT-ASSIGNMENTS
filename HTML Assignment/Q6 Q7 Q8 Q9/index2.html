      A firm is a for-profit business organization—such as a corporation, <br />
      limited liability company (LLC), <br />
      or partnership—that provides professional services. Most firms have just
      one location. <br />
      However, a business firm consists of one or more physical establishments,
      <br />
      in which all fall under the same ownership and use the <br />
      same employer identification number (EIN). <br>
